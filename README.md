## BLACK FOREST CAKE
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

Black Forest cake (American English) is a chocolate sponge cake with a rich cherry filling based on the German dessert Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte (pronounced [ˈʃvaʁt͡svɛldɐ ˈkɪʁʃˌtɔʁtə]), literally "Black Forest Cherry-torte".

Typically, Black Forest gateau consists of several layers of chocolate sponge cake sandwiched with whipped cream and cherries. It is decorated with additional whipped cream, maraschino cherries, and chocolate shavings. In some European traditions, sour cherries are used both between the layers and for decorating the top.Traditionally, kirschwasser, a clear spirit made from sour cherries, is added to the cake.Other spirits are sometimes used, such as rum, which is common in Austrian recipes. German law mandates that kirschwasser must be present in the cake for it to be labelled a Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.
